## Short Description:
- This code trains an autoencoder on the Fashion MNIST dataset.  
- It uses the Keras library to create a simple dense neural network, using an encoding dimension of 32, and a reconstruction layer to decode the encoded representation.  
- The model is trained using the Adadelta optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
- This code builds and trains a denoising autoencoder model with Keras, using a noisy version of the Fashion MNIST dataset as inputs and the original, clean images as targets.  
- The autoencoder compresses input images to a lower-dimensional space and then attempts to reconstruct the original images from the compressed representation.  
- This code constructs and trains an autoencoder model on the Fashion MNIST dataset, teaching it to remove noise from images.  
- Post-training, it visualizes denoised images and plots the model's performance metrics over the training period.
