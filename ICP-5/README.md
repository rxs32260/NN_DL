## Short Description:
-  The code snippet is an example of hyperparameter optimization in machine learning using Keras and Scikit-learn.
-  It first imports the necessary modules, KerasClassifier from Keras and GridSearchCV from Scikit-learn.
-  KerasClassifier allows for the integration of Keras models into the Scikit-learn workflow,
-  while GridSearchCV performs an exhaustive search over specified parameter values to find the best model hyperparameters.
-  In this example, the model is built using a function named createmodel, and the grid search is set up to try out different combinations of batch sizes and epochs.
-  The grid search is conducted by fitting the training data, and the best performing hyperparameters and corresponding score are printed at the end
