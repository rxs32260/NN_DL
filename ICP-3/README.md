## Short Description:
- The code generates two graphs to visualize the training process and performance of a CNN model.
- The first graph plots the training and validation loss over epochs, helping to monitor the model's learning progress.
- The second graph displays the training and validation accuracy, indicating how well the model is classifying the images.
- These visualizations aid in assessing the model's performance during training and identifying potential overfitting or underfitting.
- The graphs provide valuable insights into the CNN's behavior and can guide further adjustments to improve its performance.
- It uses the 'history' object to plot the model's training and validation loss.
- The x-axis is labeled as 'Epoch', and the y-axis is labeled as 'Loss'.
- A legend is added to the upper right corner of the plot to distinguish between training and validationÂ loss.
