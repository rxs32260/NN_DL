## Short Description:
* The code imports necessary libraries and modules: Keras, pandas, numpy, and functions from sklearn.
* The breast cancer dataset is loaded using the load_breast_cancer() function from sklearn.
* A Sequential model is created, representing a linear stack of layers in the neural network.
* Two Dense layers are added to the model, serving as hidden layers with specific configurations.
* The model is compiled, specifying the loss function, optimizer, and metric for evaluation.
* The model is trained on the training data for 100 epochs.
* The summary() function is used to display the structure and parameters of the model.
* The model's performance is evaluated on the test data using the evaluate() function.
* The evaluation results, such as loss and accuracy, are printed.
