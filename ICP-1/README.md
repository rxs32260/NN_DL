## Short Description:
1,2. Implementation Naive Bayes and Linear SVM method using scikit-learn library to evaluate the performance on test part by finding accuracy and classification report

Which algorithm you got better accuracy? Can you justify why?
Ans:
* SVM is often unsuitable for large datasets, as our data is small compared to that svm outperformed Gaussian Naive Bayes.
* It usually does a better job as it is a large margin classifier.
* a linear kernel helps us do certain calculation faster which otherwise would involve computations in higher dimensional space

3. Linear Regression 
  Import the given “Salary_Data.csv”
  Split the data in train_test partitions, such that 1/3 of the data is reserved as test subset.
  Training and predicting the model.
  Calculated the mean_squared error
  Visualized both train and test data using scatter plot
